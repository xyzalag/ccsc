The founders’ main goal was to create a place to share knowledge and diversified approaches to mind and brain sciences. <br> The Conference took place year after year for five subsequent years. In that time a number of participants presented new research and current trends in the field of Cognitive Science. Prof. Włodzisław Duch, prof. dr hab. inż. Ryszard Tadeusiewicz, prof. Edward Nęcka and many other great scientists honoured the Conference with their presence. For the next two years the Conference was withhold. Finally, thanks to the establishment of the Jagiellonian University’s Cognitive Science Student Association, the Conference meetings were resumed. The topic of the VI CCC, organised in 2014, was “SENSES”, and prof. Kevin O'Regan from Université René Descartes, a physicist and a philosopher who studies the phenomenon of visual perception and awareness, was the Key Presenter. The VII edition was held under the theme of “LANGUAGE” and Prof. Elisabetta Gola from Università di Cagliari was the special guest. In 2015 we got as many as 120 papers from all over Poland, as well as from other countries. We achieved similar success during VII edition, which main topic was “INTELLIGENCE”. That time we had the opportunity to hear out 4 specialists : dr. Adama Hampshire (Imperial College London), prof. Olivera Wilhelma (University of Ulm), dr. Jonathan Nelson and dr Tarek Besold (Free University of Bozen), their lectures were a great highlight of the conference. </p> <p class='subpage-content'> The topic that was widely discussed from many perspectives last year, in 2017, was “CONSCIOUSNESS”. We’ve been honored to guest as a keynote speaker Prof. Michael Pauen (Humboldt University of Berlin and Berlin School of Mind and Brain), Prof. Axel Cleeremans (Institute of Psychology at Universite Libre de Bruxelles and French National Research Fund (FNRS), Dr hab. Michał Wierzchoń (Jagiellonian University Institute of Psychology and C-LAB) and Dr Michał Bola (Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology). In 2017 we also organised workshops during the conference for the first time: EEG workshop run by Urszula Górska and Bridging the gap between philosophy and science” Workshop run by Juan Loaiza. Both of them were great success and we decided to organise them as well during the current edition. </p> <p class='subpage-content'> The key of our success is to create a welcoming space for an interdisciplinary discourse on the most recent topics in cognitive sciences. Our goal is to provide an opportunity for broadening horizons and enriching knowledge about each year’s edition’s special theme, in a friendly and international atmosphere. From the very beginning of its existence, the series of CCCs shows that science does not have boundaries. </p>", "registration": "<h2 class='subpage-title'> Call for Papers </h2> <p class='subpage-content'> We’re honored to invite you to participate in 10th Cracow Cognitive Science Conference, taking place 12-13 May 2018 in Cracow, Poland.
